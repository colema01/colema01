# Hi, I'm Mitch Coleman

I'm a cybersecurity officer and computer science student with an emphasis in machine learning. I currently work at MadisonHealth, where I focus on HIPAA compliance, endpoint security, vulnerability management, and access control. I'm also pursuing my degree at Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho and plan to graduate in December 2025.

I have hands-on experience with both offensive and defensive cybersecurity, data science projects, and system administration. I enjoy solving real-world problems, whether it's through automation scripts, machine learning models, or enterprise security improvements.

## Skills and Technologies

- Programming: Python, R, SQL, PowerShell, Bash
- Cybersecurity: CrowdStrike Falcon, Cisco FTD, Imprivata, Nessus, Hydra, Wireshark
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, XGBoost, CNNs, RNNs
- Data Analysis: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Altair
- Tools and Platforms: Git, GitHub, VS Code, VirtualBox, NinjaRMM
- System Administration: Windows Server, Active Directory, Ubuntu, automation scripting

## Projects and Work

- Defensive Security Labs: Completed interactive labs focused on detecting real-time attacks using Hack The Box and TryHackMe.
- Machine Learning Applications: Developed a road sign classifier using CNNs; built RNNs for text generation trained on public domain works.
- Enterprise Cybersecurity: Created internal automation tools and protocols to support secure endpoint deployment and compliance in a healthcare environment.
- Parallel and Multithreaded Programming: Built systems to handle graph traversal and prime number detection using Python's multiprocessing and threading modules.
- Data Science Cases: Conducted exploratory data analysis on real-world datasets including flight delays, housing prices, and baseball statistics.
