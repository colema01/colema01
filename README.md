# Hi, I'm Mitch Coleman

I'm a cybersecurity officer and computer science student with a focus in machine learning. I currently work at MadisonHealth, where I manage HIPAA compliance, access control, vulnerability remediation, and endpoint security. I'm earning my degree at Brigham Young University–Idaho and will graduate in December 2025.

I bring a mix of cybersecurity, system administration, and software development experience, with a growing emphasis on building intelligent systems using machine learning. I enjoy working on real-world problems that require both technical depth and practical application.

## Skills and Technologies

- Programming Languages: Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Batch, PowerShell, SQL, Clojure, R
- Machine Learning: Neural networks, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Data Science: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Altair
- Cybersecurity: Kali Linux, system hardening, access control, risk assessment
- Tools and Platforms: Git, GitHub, VS Code, VirtualBox
